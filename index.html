    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>A key structure of the mystery black box is most likely a tube and some type of system that allows the water to overflow after a certain amount of water is imputed. The tube allows the water to get into the overflow system.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box with a hidden system on the inside. You pour water into a funnel on the top and it comes out of a tube out the front of the box. Sometimes more water comes out than usual. For the first trial 500mL of water was input and 0 mL was outputted. 4 trials less water came out that was imputed to the mystery box, but after the 5th trial the black box overflowed and outputed 1915mL. We gathered data by first figuring out how we were going to get the same results and we did after testing 2 models. For our first trial we input 100mL and 0 mL came out so we were on the right track for our 2nd-4th trial the same thing happened with us; less water output then we input. Then finally for our 5th trial we input 800mL and we overflowed/spilled and we got 1500 mL output. </p>
    <h1> Reasoning Part I </h1>
    <p>The model that we created is our perception of the inside of the mystery black box. Based on our research we infer that is what's inside.</p>
    <h1> Reasoning Part II </h1>
    <p>Our evidence supports our claim because we tested the same trials as the mystery black box and received the same results, after a couple of test our system overflowed which  </p>
    <h1> Reasoning Part III </h1>
    <p>If our remake of the mystery black box did not have the tube system the way we had it and our bucket where it was, the system wouldn’t have had the same outcome as the original mystery box. This shows that our remake is probably what’s on the inside. </p>
